    - No unnecessary abstractions. Uses URLSession, URLRequest and HTTPURLResponse.
    - Progress tracking for both requests and responses.
    - Support for large files.
    - Minimalistic and single-purpose. The client should handle HTTP requests, responses and data transfer both ways. That's it.
